# Capstone_Project
Object Oriented Programming (Java) based Quiz Management System Portal

âœ…Abstract of the Project:

The Quiz Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to facilitate interactive quiz sessions for users and provide administrative control over user data and quiz content. Built using Java Swing for the GUI and standard I/O for data storage, the system allows users to log in, select a quiz difficulty (Easy, Medium, or Hard), and take a multiple-choice quiz with the assistance of a 50-50 lifeline feature.
All user login credentials and quiz scores are securely stored in text files, ensuring persistence across sessions. Users can also view their previous scores upon logging in. The admin login grants access to a dedicated Admin Panel, where all user data and quiz results can be reviewed, and quiz questions can be edited directly within the application interface.
The project adheres strictly to core Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, file handling, exception management, and GUI design using Swing. This ensures a simplified yet robust system architecture ideal for academic learning and demonstration purposes.
